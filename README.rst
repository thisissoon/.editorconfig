SOON_ Editor Config
===================

Editor config allows us to create a standard set of syntax rules for our whole
team no matter what their editor of choice is.

* Install Editor Config for your Editor: http://editorconfig.org/
* Download the `.editorconfig` file in this repository to your home directory

Some projects may also have a local settings file which overrides the root.
